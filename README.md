# QR Code Generator + URL Shortener

This is a repository to be used by us to shorten URLs for any events or campaigns or whatevers and also generate a quick QR code alongside it. The project is using Nextjs and MongoDB, and features two pages (One for actual link shortening and one as admin dashboard to manage links and see analytics). Please go over to `docs/` and especially [`Overview.md`](docs/Overview.md) to understand how to contribute
